/*
 *   Overview of how the application keeps track of its records.
 */

 1. the 'X' factor.  X being the initialization date of: January 1, 2015 0:0:00.
       Consider X the application epoch. {NOW} references current time.

     a. all things will be in relation to X.
         NOTE: this will keep back end record logic somewhat in-sync across all apps.
                  also will allow developers to predict and execute scheduled tasks.

 2. All 'root' tables will correlate with a model.  root tables will hold any and all events or logs
      that pertain to it.  tables prefixed with an identifier are partials or versions of the root.
         the identifier gives a context of time for the data, which will be used for optimization purposes.
            root to partial relationship is one to many.  

 ALL TABLE NAMES WILL USE NAMING CONVENTION: singular, lowercase, dot notation.
 
 3. All partial identifiers will start at 'year' and can go as far as 'dayOfYear'.
       Which would result in a new table being created every day. breakdown tiers:
          year,quarter[1-4],monthOfYear[1-12],weekOfYear[1-52],dayOfYear[1-365].  Even though all identifiers wil start at tier 'year',
             not all will go down to dayOfYear.   Model tier depth will depend on necessity. Every root
                table will have a depth column that specifies the tier depth of the roots partials.
