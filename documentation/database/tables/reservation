          @description: every reservation ever made will be inserted into table 'reservation'.  Which will be considered 
                         as the root/base for model type 'reservation'. Reservation will be
                           used to create a singularity amongst all contexts of reservation. reservation will hold
                              every and all reservation ever made, tables with prefixed identifiers ending in reservation 
                              are partials on reservation.  The identifier gives a context of reservation dates and times.
                                the sole purpose of this is for query optimization. Reservation dates will generally refer to the arrival day/ and last full day. (12:00:00am to 11:59:59pm).  So a res. for Jan 2, 2015 will be
                                 referenced as start:1/2/2015 end:1/2/2015 departing:1/3/2015 stay_length:1.
                                   even though guest is technically departing on the 3rd.

          @schema:      id | created | updated | cabin | start | end | guest_departs | stay_length |  depth | identifier

          @columnDefs:
                    id:    this will be the unique id/reference for all children of reservation. children will reference
                             this id under column 'reservation',
                    cabin: unique cabin id, in reference to 'cabin' model,
        
                    start: [type Date], format= 3/13/2015, referencing day of arrival or reservation start date
        
                    end: [type Date] referencing last FULL day of res, !!!NOT THE DAY THE GUEST LEAVES!!!
        
                    guest_departs: [type Date] day guest is leaving,
        
                    stay_length: number of nights of res,

                    depth: options= year,quarterOfYear,monthOfYear etc.  if year, a table variation will be created
                              once a year. All children of reservation will follow this depth pattern
        
                    identifier: ['{{year}}','{{quarter}}','{{monthOfYear}}','{{weekOfYear}}','{{dayOfYear}}']
                                  these vars are in regards to reservation 'start', regardless of end. the identifier will
                                   go as far as specidied in the depth column
